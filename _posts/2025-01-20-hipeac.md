We are pleased to announce that the DOMAIN project was presented at **HiPEAC 2025** in the delegates' poster session with a dedicated [poster]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/poster.pdf). The event provided an ideal opportunity to introduce our platform’s goals and technical architecture to the high-performance and embedded computing community.

The poster titled *"DOMAIN: Taming Heterogeneous Computing Complexity with Full-Stack Governance of Domain-Specific Languages"* highlighted our approach to managing the growing complexity of heterogeneous computing systems through a model-driven, DSL-centered workflow. We presented the full-stack design of the DOMAIN platform, from high-level language engineering down to execution on hybrid architectures combining CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.

Key aspects included our **Model-to-Model and Model-to-Text transformation chains**, which allow application-level DSLs to be automatically translated into architecture-specific binaries through a common intermediate representation based on the Actor Model. We also showcased the **hybrid runtime environment**, equipped with memory tracking, dynamic optimization, and decision-making modules driven by Answer Set Programming.

Preliminary results from a case study in **speculative stream processing**—comparing our system to Apache Spark using NYC Taxi trip data—demonstrated promising improvements in execution efficiency. We also presented our ongoing efforts to extend DOMAIN’s applicability to domains such as **discrete-event simulation, biological reactions**, and **demographic modeling**.

We thank the HiPEAC community for the interest and stimulating discussions, and we look forward to continued collaboration and feedback as the DOMAIN platform evolves.
