We are pleased to announce that our paper titled "Wielding Blockchain Transactions for Capture-Replay Testing of Upgradeable Smart Contracts" has been accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT).

This paper addresses a key research question at the core of DOMAIN: ensuring robust execution and behavioral correctness of software across dynamic and complex computing environments. Specifically, the work introduces Catana, a novel framework employing historical blockchain transactions for rigorous capture-replay testing of upgradeable smart contracts, highlighting critical aspects of automated analysis, runtime verification, and interoperability, which are pillars of the DOMAIN methodology.

This contribution further reinforces DOMAINâ€™s commitment to advancing automated and reliable software solutions in complex computing landscapes.
